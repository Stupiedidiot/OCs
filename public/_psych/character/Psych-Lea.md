During her 15th birthday, she woke up really early in the morning abd couldn't go back to sleep. she spent the entire time crying. her mom came out the room and tried to comfort her, psyche in responses would yell and tell her to leave her alone. in retrospect, psyche wishes she didn't do that because now her mom is too scared to give her a hug.
