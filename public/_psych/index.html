title: Psych!

<blockquote>
    A comic following the trio living in a dysfunctional city in a nowhere country where nothing ever goes wrong!

<p>This is comic I initially thought up back in 2019-ish..? It's a absurdist 'monster of the week' episodic comic series - it will make more sense once I actually get to making it lol. It holds a very special place in my heart and practically consumes my every waking moment. I genuinely don't know where I'll be without them,,</p>
