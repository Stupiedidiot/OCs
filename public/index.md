# Stupied OCs
Henloo, this is Stupied!!! Currently still figuring out my workflow so please visit my [Main Website](https://stupied.neocities.org/) while I configure everything,,

# About the Artist
I make no exaggeration when I say I would of killed myself if it weren't for my OCs. If you ever been unfortunate enough to meet me in real life, I am very likely to be staring blanky into the distance - daydreaming. I find it difficult to experience life as it is and need to disassociate to let the little guys in my head relive my present.

I hold my ocs to an incredibly high regard and I felt the need to properly archive them. 

# About the Website
In an attempt to make the ultimate OC repository, I am using Obsidian to write which I then sync to my website folder. The markdown files are converted to webpages with Jekyll and are then deployed to Neocities with Github. This website is still really young so I'm still figuring out a good workflow.

The website's design is heavily influenced (aka stolen) from one of [LiteralHat's](https://literalhat.com/articles/4/the-history-of-literalhatcom) scrapped website concept. Maybe one day I'll put the time and effort to make my own design, who knows really.
