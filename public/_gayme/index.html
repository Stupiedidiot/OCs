<p>This is for a dumb visual novel idea I had. Still don't have a title for it and I'm too lazy to fully explain it so have this lengthy reddit comment I made a while back</p>

<blockquote>
    i don't have that much public writings of them because it's for a dream video game idea that will probably take me years to come into fruition. basically the three of them are from a fictitious socialist country that takes pride in their music. the country has been struggling economically so the dictator decides to hold an event to showcase their youth's talents and finally let foreigners in (after years on insisting they were evil and shouldn't be trusted). During the event, a terrorist group intercepts and stops the event from occurring. mopsy (the blonde) and pepper (one with a scarf) find themselves trapped in the hotel where the event was supposed to take place in. they're stuck with other performers and a robotic penguin that acts as a host. the penguin explain to all of them that they're being broadcasted live and the only way to get out of the building is to murder someone without getting caught (sorta like in danganronpa). they'll have to hold court cases where the group tries to figure out who the murderer is. the gameplay will be inspired by the ace attorney games, where the player (mopsy) will argue back and forth with "prosecutor" (pepper). Although the two are childhood best friends, pepper likes to piss mopsy off for fun. The kid with the blue hat is the sister of one of the orchastra players (she acts as a judge in-game), and she is highly perceptive. She always knows who's the killer but wont ever tell the player because she to scared too (she doesn't want to be the next target since she's a lot younger and weaker than everyone else in the group). She gets really depressed whenever the player accuses the wrong person. She's basically the gumshoe to the game's edgeworth (pepper).
