Henloooo!!! Decided to mess around with Static Site Generators because I wanted a way for my obsidian files to sync with this website. This way I could just add in the raw md files straight from my folders and let Jekyll do all the work of converting it to html. Still incredibly new to this so I'm still trying to figure a lot of things out. 

<span class="test">I will most likely prioritize the functionality over the aesthetics. Which is to say that everything's gonna look really ugly for as long as it takes me to configure everything to my liking.</span>

## To Do
- Categories for different universes / comics
- Some system for the galleries??? - lightboxes??
- A proper navigation and footer
- Different widgets for stuff (like relationships)
- Syncing this folder with specific obsidian folders
- remove the ugly ass spacing between headers
